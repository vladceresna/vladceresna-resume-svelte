                In 2014 when I was 5 years old, war broke out in eastern Ukraine where I lived. 
                Bombs were falling literally meters away from me.
                That's why my father and grandfather died.
                I had to change 4 schools in 1st grade.
                My family and I had to leave after losing everything we had and starting life almost from scratch.

                In second grade, I moved to a new school. 
                I only had one friend. I didn't have a phone or a computer. 
                In the summer I had to pick raspberries, apples, cucumbers in the village and sell them.
                I studied normally. I've always had a desire to create. 
                I had a hobby - origami. Later I even had a YouTube channel on the subject.

                Even before the war, I sang solo on the big stage and played a little piano. 
                After I moved away, I continued to sing on the big stage and play the piano quite well. 
                Later, in 5th grade, I got an accordion and moved on to learn it. 
                Now I play the accordion well and improvise well, as well as compose my own music a bit. 
                After the COVID-19 pandemic, I started singing a lot less, but I still enjoy doing it, and I'm even doing it even better.

                When pandemic started, I started programming in 8th grade before school even started teaching python programming. So when the school started teaching it, I already knew it and wrote a practical paper with an excellent grade. Then I won (1st place) at the district Olympiad on programming using python. On it I learned to create computer programs on Tkinter. But, later I needed to create normal programs on the phone. Since it was the only phone I had. Accordingly, I started to learn Java and wrote code in AIDE. The difficult conditions created ideal conditions for teaching me how to write proper code. I created just a sea of different programs, and thanks to that I learned how to do it correctly. Later I learned about html/css and again, when no one in my class had ever heard of the concept of “hosting”, I had already organized hosting of my website on a domain from Freenom.
                <br>Later I got a computer.

                I started making plans to create my own programming language and operating system 
                (without knowing anything about their design), 
                and wanted to create an alternative to Google's ecosystem of services.
                That's when I started building and created my very first normal project - 
                my online services system, which is now called Rula, contains a forum, private mail, 
                private chats and cloud storage and is built on Material 2 and Firebase.

                All schools from the time of the pandemic have continued with distance learning. 
                While schools did not have normal tools for distance learning. 
                Schools used 6 learning platforms at once: Viber for communication,

                This was, without exaggeration, the most legendary project 
                I`ve ever built - not because it succeeded fast, 
                but because it taught me leadership, architecture, and patience.
                <br><br>
                I've been in development since the summer. 
                I created a Spring MVC project for myself on a templating tool (yes, nobody does that), 
                wrote down everything I wanted to be and spent 2 months designing the platform in Figma. 
                Then I changed the templating engine to Spring Vaadin - a framework that makes development easier with ready-made interface elements. 
                Data was stored in RedisJSON. In 3 months I made registration, login, school and test creation. 
                Well, as you understand, I failed to create the platform by the beginning of the school year. 
                So I started looking for a team. I found 6 people who immediately left, 
                and with the next 6 people changed technologies to standard Spring Boot+PostgreSQL+Angular17. 
                Introduced Jira for task tracking. After that my team grew to 10+ people and we moved to ClickUp. 
                All this time we worked hard on building the backend and frontend.
                <br><br>
                All this time I was hiring staff (mostly university students and older), 
                bringing people up to speed, giving them tasks, training those who didn't know 
                anything, and of course contributing the most to the development.
                <br><br>
                Later we had 2 project managers who helped a lot with team management. 
                Later it turned out that everyone in our team knows React, but no one 
                knows Angular, and we switched to Next.js. Later we reached ClickUp limits and 
                moved to Linear. Sometimes people left and we had to find new ones. 
                But we always had 30 people on the team. That's how a year went by. 
                The platform also had login and registration again, school creation, 
                class creation and even assignment management.
                <br><br>
                But that was nothing compared to all our plans. 
                And teamwork was slower than if I`d done it on my own. 
                So we decided to put the project on hold and start from scratch when everyone 
                could devote enough time to it.

                At the same time, my next attempt to create my own 
                programming language was successful, and I created Virtually.
                Later, I tried to convert it into an operating system using C++, 
                but after trying several paths, including Rust Bevy, LibGDX, Flutter, 
                I settled on Kotlin Compose Multiplatform. And renamed it to Virtel. 
                I created it because I didn't like how painful it can be to configure a complex 
                project to work, and even cross-platform. Accordingly, if you create a program 
                on Virtel, you don't have to configure the runtime environment, 
                libraries and cross-platform compilation. There is no compilation as such at all. 
                There is only interpretation. Because of all this, the program size remains 
                within 10 KB. And this program can be a server with an interface and work 
                great even on a phone. Just like a browser, only with its own programming 
                language and with much more capabilities. 
                <br><br>
                The site I created about this 
                platform took 1st place in the competition of final projects of students 
                of Summer IT School 2024 from Star For Life Ukraine. It also won 1st place 
                in the all-Ukrainian competition Encode The Future: Sustainable Development. 
                After that, I wrote a 30-page research paper JASU about my development. 
                This paper won 3rd place in my region. Later, I added support for the fast 
                Rust language, cryptography, and voice to my project. 
                Then I submitted this project to the all-Ukrainian competition Infomatrix Ukraine, 
                where I received a bronze medal. All these victories show both my level of 
                creativity, skills, and presentation skills, as well as the great work 
                I did on this project.
                <br><br>
                To tell the truth, I think that my project could have won a much higher place 
                and even won the world Infomatrix competition, but my project is simply ahead 
                of its time. Now, when everyone is thinking about optimizations using artificial 
                intelligence (which is not environmentally friendly and can be very wrong 
                (hallucinating)), I am thinking about optimizations using programming. 
                And about how to create more with minimal costs and with greater benefit 
                for ordinary users who do not have terabytes of memory in their devices.
                <br><br>
                At the same time, in grades 10 and 11, 
                I also won the regional programming Olympiad and thus passed the 
                IT Skills Standard Certification three times.
                <br><br>
                As a result, I graduated from school with honors.
